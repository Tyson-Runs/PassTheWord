# PassTheWord
Password generator and facial recognition verifier

Generates passwords with discriptive nouns and symbols so they are easy to remember by employees but hard to hack

Facial recognition creates an automated system for employees to reset their own passwords securely on any company device linked to the same server

XOR encryption ensures safe keeping of photo and password data

Libraries used: random, tkinter, opencv, dlib, face_recognition, numpy, os
